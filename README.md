###**Unofficial** Objective-C Mega SDK wrapper


**Note**: This project was abandoned but feel free to fork it and submit pull requests!

##Wrapper around the C++ SDK for Mega.co.nz 

###Supported Features
Most of the features available in the [Mega public C++ SDK](https://mega.co.nz/sdk.zip) are implemented. You still need to compile [cryptopp](https://github.com/tagyro/CryptoPP-for-iOS) (you can try replacing it with `Security.framework`)

###Planned Features
**None**. I'm not working on this project anymore, if you want to add features and make it more stable feel free to fork and submit pull requests.

###Usage
Clone this repository, clone [cryptopp](https://github.com/tagyro/CryptoPP-for-iOS), download [Mega C++ SDK](https://mega.co.nz/sdk.zip), compile and pray it runs.  

###Documentation of Code

There are some comments in the code but nothing more.
